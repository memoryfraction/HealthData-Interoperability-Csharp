## 📌 Project Overview

In the modern healthcare landscape, data interoperability is critical. This project serves as a comprehensive showcase of my expertise in building FHIR-compliant applications using the **Fire.ly SDK**, ranging from basic RESTful interactions to advanced resource validation and complex search patterns.

It is structured as a **multi-project solution**, where each module addresses a specific real-world interoperability challenge.

## 🚀 Learning Path & Features

## Phase 1: The Foundation (Completed)
Based on the foundational principles of the [Fire.ly SDK](https://fire.ly/), I have implemented:
* **FHIR Client Setup**: Configuring the `FhirClient` with appropriate headers and settings.
* **Basic CRUD Operations**: Reading, creating, and searching for `Patient` resources.
* **Data Parsing**: Handling FHIR-specific JSON/XML serialization.
* **Error Handling**: Managing `OperationOutcome` and HTTP status codes in a healthcare context.

**Execution Result:**

## Phase 03: FHIR Resource Validator (The Data Firewall)
### What does this code actually do?
In healthcare, "bad data" (like an invalid birth date) isn't just a bug—it's a clinical risk. This module implements a **Medical Data Firewall** using the Firely SDK.

Instead of writing hundreds of manual `if-else` statements, this code:
1. **Loads the "Official Law"**: It connects to `specification.zip` (the HL7 FHIR R4 standard definitions).
2. **Performs Semantic Audit**: It validates resources against complex medical rules, such as:
   - **Date Logic**: Identifying that `1990-13-45` is an impossible date.
   - **Data Integrity**: Checking if a `Telecom` entry is missing its required value.

### Why is this important?
- **Ensures Interoperability**: Guarantees that the data you produce will be accepted by other FHIR-compliant systems (like Epic or Cerner).
- **Automated Governance**: Automatically enforces cardinality (required fields) and value sets (allowed codes).

### Output Breakdown
If you see an **[ERROR]** in the console, **it means the code is working perfectly!** It successfully "caught" the invalid data before it could reach a database.

## 04-Data-Mapping-ETL (Legacy Integration)
This module demonstrates a professional-grade ETL pipeline to migrate legacy CSV patient data into a FHIR R4 ecosystem.
* **Idempotency (幂等性)**: Implemented via **Conditional PUT**, ensuring that re-running the job updates existing records instead of creating duplicates.
* **Atomic Transactions**: Uses `Bundle.BundleType.Transaction` to guarantee data integrity.
* **Automated Verification**: The system automatically queries the server post-upload to confirm `VersionId` and `LastUpdated` metadata.

**Execution Result:**

## 05-SMART-on-FHIR (Interoperability & Security)
This module demonstrates how to securely ingest data into a **(g)(10) certified** healthcare ecosystem using the **SMART on FHIR** framework.
* **US Core Compliance**: Unlike basic ETL, this module maps data strictly to the **US Core Patient Profile**, ensuring the resources meet federal interoperability standards (ONC g10).
* **JWT-Ready Architecture**: Implements a strategic "Bypass & Document" approach—validating mapping logic via Open Endpoints while architecting the system to be compatible with **OAuth2 Access Tokens**.
* **Security Implementation**: Demonstrates the theoretical workflow of **SMART App Launch**, including the use of **Scopes** (e.g., `patient/*.read`) to manage granular data access.



### 💡 04 vs 05: The Evolution
* **Module 04 (ETL)**: Focuses on **Data Quality**. How to clean messy legacy data and ensure idempotency using **Conditional PUT**.
* **Module 05 (SMART)**: Focuses on **Compliance & Security**. How to follow the **US Core Implementation Guide** and handle authorized access in a regulated ecosystem.
